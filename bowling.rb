#method that calculates each bowl score

##write a loop that loops 10 times
final_score = []
bowl = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

10.times do
  bowl1 = input
  if bowl1 = 10
    return 10
  bowl2 = input
    if bowl1 + bowl2 = 10
      #write spare code
    end 
    
  final_score << round_bowl 
end 

print final_score






###write another loop that loops 2 times

####return number of pins knocked down first + number of pins knowcked down second bowl

#if both add to ten, 

##subtracts knowcked down pins from total number of pins

###if no pins knocked down give points for a strike

#mothod that puts in the individual bowl score into an array

#method that adds the points in the array

#return array
